# GradesCounter

  First project for school I created, it calculates the average grade from dynamically generadeted radio buttons.

  If validation of form doesn't pass, user gets a Toast that informs him that something went wrong. Then new page is loading where user picks one grade for every radio group that was generated. After that, page is changing back to the main one where user can see his average grades with green color if he passed or red if not and gets notification if he has to pay for new year or not.
