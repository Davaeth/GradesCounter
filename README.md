# GradesCounter

  First project for school, it counts the average grade from dynamically generadeted radio buttons.

  If validation of form won't pass user obtains a Toast that informs him something went wrong. Then new page is loading where user picks one grade for every radio groub that was generated. After that, page is changing back to the main one where user can see his average grades with green color if he passed or red if not and earns notification if he has to pay for new year or not.
